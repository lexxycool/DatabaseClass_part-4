-- Bill Murray Problem

-- 12. Create a "Bill Murray Collection" in the collection table. 
-- For the movies that have Bill Murray in them, set 
-- their collection ID to the "Bill Murray Collection". (1 row, 6 rows)

INSERT INTO collection (collection_name) VALUES ('Bill Murray Collection');
select * from collection;

-- movie table does not contain data on the specfic actors
SELECT * from movie;

-- the associative table movie_actor can help me answer the question 
-- which movies do Bill Murray appear in:
SELECT * 
FROM movie_actor
JOIN person ON movie_actor.actor_id = person.person_id
WHERE person_name = 'Bill Murray';
-- We learn that Bill murray appears in films with the following
-- movie_id's: 399174
--10315
--120467
--83666
--137
--10433

-- What is the id of the newly inserted collection?
select * from collection where collection_name = 'Bill Murray Collection';
-- We learn that the Bill Murray Collection has an id of 1795483.


-- Let's write the query with the information hardcoded:
UPDATE movie
SET collection_id = 1795483 -- <-- this can be obtained through a subquery
WHERE movie_id IN(10315, 120467, 83666, 137, 10433); -- <-- this can be obtained through a sub


UPDATE movie
SET collection_id = (select collection_id from collection where collection_name = 'Bill Murray Collection')
WHERE movie_id IN (
SELECT movie_id 
FROM movie_actor
JOIN person ON movie_actor.actor_id = person.person_id
WHERE person_name = 'Bill Murray'
);
